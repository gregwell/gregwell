# Hi, I'm Grzegorz Studzinski 👋

I'm making my best effort to start thinking in JavaScript! (from mid-January '21)

**I break most things down into *projects.*** Each one has some goals and I strive to achieve them. 🎯 

- 📝 [Complete list of my projects](projects.md)
- ⏱️ [Month in review (2021)](month-in-review.md)

In such a way I can perfectly organise my work , manage my time  (I do other things too! 🎨🚴) and keep track of my growth.
