### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**TLDR: I'm making my best effort to start thinking in JS/React. I'm looking for a summer internship! ðŸ‘€**

I am a final year student of Applied Computer Science at AGH University of Technology in Cracow, Poland. During these studies I've attended to some typical engineering courses like [algorithms and data structures](https://github.com/gregwell/algorithms-and-data-structures), [numerical methods](https://github.com/gregwell/numerical-methods) and spent some time with the real *applied* computer science like the [FEM course](https://github.com/gregwell/fem-simulations). The programming languages that I have been using were C++, Java, C, [x86 Assembly](https://github.com/gregwell/x86-assembly). Apart from studies, from time to time I work as a graphic designer. I create logos, leaflets, business cards, billboards, web layouts or even bottle labels for different Polish companies. 

I enetered web development world to combine my passion for programming and creating design. I started learning JavaScript in mid-January from the back-end side (Node.js) and then switched to front-end (React.js) as **developing *visual* things that make delightful user experiences seems to give me the greatest satisfaction.** Since then Iâ€™m working almost everyday to improve my skills and get into that business. 

I'm looking for a challenging JS full-stack / front-end (React.js) student internship! I can work full-time: July, August, September '21 or any month part-time. I'm open to talk, don't hesistate to contact me! [![Linkedin](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grzegorzstudzinski/)
