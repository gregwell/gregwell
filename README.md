### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**TLDR: I'm making my best effort to start thinking in JavaScript/React. I'm looking for a summer internship! ðŸ‘€**

I am a final year student of Applied Computer Science at AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow, Poland. I've attended typical engineering courses such as [algorithms and data structures](https://github.com/gregwell/algorithms-and-data-structures) or [numerical methods](https://github.com/gregwell/numerical-methods) and also spent some time on really *applied* computer science like the [FEM course](https://github.com/gregwell/fem-simulations). The programming languages I have used are mainly C++, Java, C, but I have also written programs in [x86 Assembly](https://github.com/gregwell/x86-assembly), Python and recently started writing in JavaScript. Apart from studying, I work as a graphic designer, creating logos, flyers, business cards, billboards, website layouts or even bottle labels for various Polish companies.

I enetered the world of web development to combine my design thinking and programming skills. I started learning JavaScript in mid-January from the back-end side (Node.js) and then switched to front-end (React.js) as **developing *visual* things that make delightful user experience seems to give me the greatest satisfaction.** Since then I have been working almost everyday to improve my skills and get into this business. 

I'm looking for a challenging JS full-stack / front-end (React.js) student internship! I can work full-time July, August, September '21 or any month part-time. I'm open to talk, don't hesistate to contact me! [![Linkedin](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grzegorzstudzinski/)
