### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**TLDR: Currently I'm making my best effort to start thinking in React. I'm looking for a summer internship.**

I am a final year student of Applied Computer Science at AGH University of Technology in Cracow, Poland. During these studies I've attended to some typical engineering courses like [algorithms and data structures](https://github.com/gregwell/algorithms-and-data-structures), [numerical methods](https://github.com/gregwell/numerical-methods/tree/master/NumericalMethods3/NumericalMethods3) and also spend some time with the real *applied* computer science like the [FEM course](https://github.com/gregwell/fem-simulations). The programming languages that I have been using were C++, Java, C. Apart from studies, from time to time I work as a graphic designer: creating logos, leaflets business cards, web layouts or bottle labels.

At the end of the last year I was thinking profusely where I see myself in 5 years. Finally, in January I understood that my place on earth is somewhere between creating design and more computational stuff. Wandering between writing 'heavy' cpp files and reading ui/ux design case studies gave me the idea to introduce myself to JavaScript world. Firstly, I've created [a RESTful API](https://github.com/gregwell/activity-hub), that I've used also for passing an university course. Then I started to work with React to dive more into front-end. Currently, I'm learning the overall idea, the logic behind and javascript itself, mainly by writing short chunks of code, [analyzing a huge MERN-stack project and understanding its logic](https://github.com/gregwell/the-facebook) or creating [text notes](https://github.com/gregwell/university-notes/tree/main/english/javascript) that I put in my brand new notes repo.

In the coming months I will definitely do a larger project myself. You can follow my personal development on this page. Also, I need to take part in a 4-week apprenticeships this summer (requirement from my university), but I'm ready to take part in a 3-month internship, which would be a more preferred option. (July, August, September '21). Feel free to contact me.
