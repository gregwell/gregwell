### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**TLDR: I'm making my best effort to start thinking in React. I'm looking for a summer internship! ðŸ‘€**

I am a final year student of Applied Computer Science at AGH University of Technology in Cracow, Poland. During these studies I've attended to some typical engineering courses like [algorithms and data structures](https://github.com/gregwell/algorithms-and-data-structures), [numerical methods](https://github.com/gregwell/numerical-methods/tree/master/NumericalMethods3/NumericalMethods3) and spent some time with the real *applied* computer science like the [FEM course](https://github.com/gregwell/fem-simulations). The programming languages that I have been using were C++, Java, C. Apart from studies, from time to time I work as a graphic designer: creating logos, leaflets, business cards, billboards, web layouts or even bottle labels.

At the end of the last year I was thinking profusely where I see myself in 5 years. Finally, in mid-January I understood that my place on earth is somewhere between creating design and programming. Wandering between writing 'heavy' cpp files calculating the heat flow and reading ui/ux design case studies gave me the idea to enter the world of front-end. The first step was the decision to write a school project of [a RESTful API](https://github.com/gregwell/activity-hub) in Javascript (Node.js). To know how to start I followed line by line the code of a huge full-stack project of a social media app. The HTTP request-response data flow excited me very much, however, I knew that I want to combine it with creating beautiful things.. this is when React came to play. I rewritten the entire application and [analyzed every single file and the logic behind](https://github.com/gregwell/the-facebook), but along the way I had to go back to the basics of JavaScript. I've created some notes on [Javascript](https://github.com/gregwell/university-notes/blob/main/english/javascript/javascript.md) & [React](https://github.com/gregwell/university-notes/blob/main/english/javascript/react.md) (and Redux) in general. So far, I' ve gathered some theoretical knowledge and will write a bigger project on my own in the coming weeks. You can follow my React journey on this page, as I like to make things transparent.

I'm looking for a challenging React student internship! I can work full-time: July, August, September '21. Feel free to contact me! ðŸ’¬
